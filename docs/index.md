## About This Site
This platform serves as a structured documentation hub for my journey in understanding and implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts, with a primary focus on building a GPT model. The content is heavily based on [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai)'s Neural Networks: Zero to Hero series and aims to provide well-organized insights, implementations, and notes for anyone following a similar path.

This site is designed for:

- Learners and developers interested in AI and deep learning.

- Anyone following Karpathy's Zero to Hero series.

- The open-source community looking for structured references and implementations.

## Documentation structure
The learning resources are divided into two primary sections: **Set-1** and **Set-2**.

**Set-1: Language Modeling Framework**
