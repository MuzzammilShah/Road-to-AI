# :simple-neutralinojs: Zero to Hero Series

This repository serves as a structured documentation hub for my journey in understanding and implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts, with a primary focus on building a GPT model. The content is heavily based on [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai)'s **Neural Networks: Zero to Hero series** and aims to provide well-organized insights, implementations, and notes for anyone following a similar path.

## üìÅ Documentation structure
The learning resources are divided into three primary sections: **Language Models**, **Transformer Models** and **General MISC**.
