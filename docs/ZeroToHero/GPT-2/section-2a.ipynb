    "So, in our case, right now, **pytorch has its tensors of the type float32 by default** (see screenshot below), so thats 19.5 tflops according to sensei's GPU specs. Now, our aim is to be able to utilize the GPU to a better extent right? therefore we will try to change the dtype into those which are lower in those table specs, inorder to get in more tflops for processing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Also, **why are we doing this and not just go ahead with the default dtype?** It seems float32 is a little too high for a computational workload when it comes to deeplearning. Therefore we can make it lower, to smaller precision. But it is also important to note that not all hardwares/GPU can provide such precision, and thats where top expensive GPUs come in like A100 where as shown in the image can process even the highest i.e. FP64 (which apparently is quite useful for scientific computing applications and there they really need this).\n",

There will be cases where the CPU keeps allocating and without waiting for the GPU to finish it will call the `.time()` even though that task was not yet finished.
