## Hello, Welcome to my Road to GPT Documentation site!

### 👋🏻About Me
I am Muhammed Muzzammil Shah, currently working as a Junior Software Engineer at a startup. My primary focus is on implementing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning solutions.

If you would like to learn more about me, please feel free to visit my [official website](https://muhammedshah.com)!

&nbsp;

### 🎯Purpose of this site
I created this platform to serve as a repository for all my notes and practical implementations related to everything I have learned on my journey toward implementing the GPT model.

My Learning path follows **[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai)'s Neural Networks: Zero to Hero** series.

### 🗃️Documentation structure
I have divided my learning resources into two sections: **Set-1** and **Set-2**.

**Set-1 will focus on Language Modelling Framework**

|Path | Implementation of | Link |
|------|--------|------|
|Backpropagation|Micrograd|[Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/PaCmpygFfXo?si=YW_rkr7LU44YwouD)|
|Language Model-1|Makemore (Part 1)|[Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/PaCmpygFfXo?si=mJ8mN4QhPB997R0p)|
|Language Model-2|Makemore (Part 2)|[Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/TCH_1BHY58I?si=jvfgiqzLoRVSgj8u)|
|Language Model-3|Makemore (Part 3)|[Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/P6sfmUTpUmc?si=6072SkRZSdY1pPB2)|
|Language Model-4|Makemore (Part 4)|[Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/q8SA3rM6ckI?si=e-ON-yHPUtFWzY2L)|
|Language Model-5|Makemore (Part 5)|[Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/t3YJ5hKiMQ0?si=kPSjBl8rkxMlQEhv)|

**Set-2 will focus on the Transformer Neural Network**
